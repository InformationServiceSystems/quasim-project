# QUASIM
Quantum Computing Enhanced Service Ecosystem for Simulation in Manufacturing


## Project Description
The aim of the project "QC-Enhanced Service Ecosystem for Simulation in Manufacturing" (QUASIM) is to develop and test quantum computing (QC) algorithms and technologies for critical simulation issues in manufacturing, to embed them methodically in Industry 4.0 frameworks as "Quantum-as-a-Service" (QaaS) and to transfer practical knowledge on production-oriented simulation based on QC. With the help of different QC algorithms and technologies, QUASIM will investigate whether and how simulations of manufacturing processes can be optimised and accelerated. 

In the first part of QUASIM, we combine QC with the numerical models of the framework (QC-numerical approach); in the second part of the project, QC with the ML models of the framework with QC (QC-ML approach) (cf. figure). Both approaches are to be compared with the standard approach of execution via the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) on semiconductor computers (baseline). Implemented services based on QC numerics and QC ML (QaaS) will be integrated into the existing Digital Twin Framework. This opens the door to QC applications in an existing digital infrastructure for industrial end users and drives the use of QC in the industrial environment (see figure). 

Results and basic application possibilities of QC are communicated to mechanical engineering companies via the excellent industrial networks of the project partners in workshops and symposia. The results are also introduced into the standardisation processes of German industry. With QUASIM, manufacturing companies are presented with how QC can be used practically to identify and implement competitive advantages in the medium and long term. QUASIM thus sets a milestone in innovation for the future success of German mechanical engineering.
